# Introduction
 
In recent years the integration of large-scale biomedical knowledge sources and machine learning has accelerated patient stratification in rare disease. However, such projects often focus on known diseases within large and phenotypically diverse cohorts.

Our research team studies a subset of rare diseases characterized by dysregulation of the innate immune system, termed *autoinflammation*. Many of these disorders have highly overlapping phenotypic profiles, which often clouds downstream analysis and diagnosis.

In order to better understand clinical variation within our cohort, we leverage the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) to guide two unsupervised machine learning pathways. As a proof-of-concept we attempt to cluster a subset of 54 patients in our cohort with Deficiency of Adenosine Deaminase 2 (DADA2), a disease known to be clinically heterogeneous. 


**General HPO Structure**

```{r, include=TRUE, fig.cap="The HPO provides a structured vocabulary of phenotypic abnormalities encountered in human disease, and has become the *de facto* standard for studying the complex relationship between genetic variants and clinical presentation.  . https://hpo.jax.org/app/tools/loinc2hpo", out.width="100%"}

```



# Methods

**Data Generation & Preprocessing**

Source code for analysis will be hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/Ryan-Laird/PhenoClustR).

```{r, include=TRUE, out.width="100%", fig.cap='A BTRIS query was used to gather all clinical notes for 54 DADA2 patients on our protocol. A natural language processing tool, ClinPhen, was used to extract HPO term occurance from the corpus. To avoid redundancy, R package `ontologySimilarity` was applied to generate a minimal term set per patient.'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("figures", "data_generation.png"))
```


**Clustering Approaches**

Each patient was treated as a binary vector of their minimal term set (e.g. Arthritis: 0, Ischemic Stroke: 1, ...).

```{r}
clust_tbl <- 
  tibble("Approach" = c("Ontology Similarity", "HPO2Vec"),
             `Patient Similarity Metric` = c("Lin", "Average Term  Embedding"),
             `Clustering Method` = c("Leiden", "PCA, UMAP, HDBSCAN"),
             "Pros" = c("Easier to interpret, rewards granular data", "Closer to expert opinion"),
             "Cons" = c("No connections between organ systems", "Not directly interpretable"))
```


```{r, include=TRUE}
kable(clust_tbl, align = "c", caption = "Comparison of Patient Clustering Approaches") %>% 
  kable_styling("striped", full_width = TRUE, position = "center")
```

## HPO2Vec

To enrich the HPO with cross organ system associations, a new edge was drawn between any two phenotypes if they shared a common Orphanet disease annotation. 

```{r, include=TRUE, fig.cap="An example Node2Vec embedding that depicts node homophily. https://snap.stanford.edu/node2vec"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures", "node2vec_example.png"))
```



# Results

**Patient Clusters**
```{r}
cluster_plot <- plot_median + plot_emb

ggsave(plot = cluster_plot, filename = here::here("figures", "onto_emb_cluster.png"))
```


```{r, include=TRUE, fig.cap="Leiden clustering by ontology similarity; HDBSCAN Clustering by Average HPO2Vec Embedding Space."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures", "onto_emb_cluster.png"))
```

**Cluster Interpretation**

```{r}

text_tbl <- tibble(
 
   Clusters = c(1,2,3,1,2,3),
  
  "Frequent Terms" = c("Stroke, Arthritis", 
                       "Abdominal Pain, Neutropenia",
                       "Red Cell Aplasia, Vasculitis",
                       "Stroke, Arthritis", 
                       "Abdominal Pain, Neutropenia",
                       "Red Cell Aplasia, Vasculitis"),
  
  "Qualitative Category" = c("inflam", "marrow", "other", "inflam", "marrow", "other")
)



```

```{r, include=TRUE}
kable(text_tbl, align = "c", caption = "Phenotypic Comparison of Patient Clusters") %>% 
  kable_styling("striped", full_width = TRUE, position = "center") %>% 
  pack_rows("Onto Sim", 1,3) %>% 
  pack_rows("HPO2Vec", 4,6)
```


# Discussion

As with any unsupervised method, perhaps the most difficult step is interpretation. Future work includes a deeper dive into the clinical nature of each respective cluster, and a more robust comparison of direct ontology similarity vs HPO term embedding. 

If patient clusters are clinically relevant, we hope to apply these methods to better stratify undifferentiated patients that make up ~60% of our cohort.
